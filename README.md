=======

ODAS stands for Open embeddeD Audition System. This is a library dedicated to perform sound source localization, tracking, separation and post-filtering. ODAS is coded entirely in C, for more portability, and is optimized to run easily on low-cost embedded hardware. ODAS is free and open source.

The [ODAS wiki](https://github.com/introlab/odas/wiki) describes how to build and run the software.

ROS: Please visite the [odas_ros project](https://github.com/introlab/odas_ros).
